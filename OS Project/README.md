This project is an interactive web-based simulator for various CPU scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, SJF, RR, SRTF, and Priority Scheduling. Users can input process details, visualize scheduling through Gantt charts, and analyze key performance metrics such as turnaround time and waiting time.
Supports multiple CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, RR, SRTF, Priority)
Interactive user interface with process input form
Real-time visualization using Gantt charts
Computation of turnaround time & waiting time
Intuitive and easy-to-use design
